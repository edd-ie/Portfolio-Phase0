# Project: Build a Personal Website

## Goals

- Build a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Publish a website

## Requirements

This project is an opportunity to showcase what you've learned so far, so it is
important that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are incorporated into the project in
some way. For example, you could use a `mouseover` event to change the
appearance of an element when the user mouses over it. Or use a `click` event to
toggle some content between being visible and hidden. There are a variety of
ways to do this using the CSS and JavaScript you've learned so far, but don't
forget you can always use Google if you get stuck. Google is an invaluable tool
for developers! Try to use this project as an opportunity to stretch your coding
skills!

The content, styling, and functionality of your site are up to you. Keep in mind
that you may show this project to your peers and future instructors, so be
considerate of content/subject matter and your potential audience.

## Professional Git Development Workflow

When it comes to Git, there is ultimately no rule that says you _must_ do things
a certain way. However, if there was anything we could impart to you regarding
good version control habits, it would be this â€” commit code frequently.

As mentioned, it is a common habit to dive into the code of a project and write
as much as you can, for as long as you can. However, not only does this increase
the chance for bugs, it will result in very large Git commits or just _one_ big
commit for everything.

Repositories with a good commit history can relay a story about their
development from just the commit messages alone. 

## Conclusion

Once you've finished building your website, make sure to push it all up to
GitHub.
